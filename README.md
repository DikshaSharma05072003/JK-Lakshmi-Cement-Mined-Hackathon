# JK-Lakshmi-Cement-Mined-Hackathon

Track Name : Manufacturing

- Problem statement :-
Human Face Recognition by using Computer Vison (Deep Learning)

Overview :-
In this project, team task is to identify the human face real time from a CCTV (For this project we will provide you Video Clip) camera with the help of computer Vision. If CCTV camera frame (image from the Video) contains multiple faces, then developed model must have capability to recognize all the faces in frame.
After recognition of faces developed, Software will return the face identity (For Example Employee Code) and Date and time of recognition in a csv file (You can also insert the record into MySQL database).

 - Dataset :-
The repositry contains the dataset provided by the track sponser which includes images and a video file.

About the model

 - Programming language used :-
The above code for human face detection is implemented in Jupyter notebook.

- Modules/Packages needed :-
1. OpenCV
2. Tkinter
3. PIL

- Approach :-
We have designed a GUI based Python project for problem. 
Our project uses python libraries to detect faces from the provided CCTV video.
We have used the haar cascade algorithm to detect faces in images, irrespective of their scale in image and location. 
Our project can run real time as well to detect faces from a live video accessed via webcam. 
Moreover, the images of the human faces captured from the CCTV video is stored in a file as specified in the code.
