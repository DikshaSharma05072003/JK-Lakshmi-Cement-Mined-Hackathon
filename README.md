# JK-Lakshmi-Cement-Mined-Hackathon

Track Name : Manufacturing

- Problem statement :-
Human Face Recognition by using Computer Vison (Deep Learning)

Overview :-
In this project, team task is to identify the human face real time from a CCTV (For this project we will provide you Video Clip) camera with the help of computer Vision. If CCTV camera frame (image from the Video) contains multiple faces, then developed model must have capability to recognize all the faces in frame.
After recognition of faces developed, Software will return the face identity (For Example Employee Code) and Date and time of recognition in a csv file (You can also insert the record into MySQL database).

 - Dataset :-
The repositry contains the dataset provided by the track sponser which includes images and a video file.

About the model
